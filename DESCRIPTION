Title: Get Coordinates In Decimal Form
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Melinda Blumenstock
Maintainer: Melinda Blumenstock <mb2316@georgetown.edu>
Description: This package contains one function, get_coordinates(), that takes latitude and longitude values in the form of lists, as well as a character delimiter. Each lat and long value must be in "xxÂ°yy.zz'N/S/E/W" form. The function uses a for loop to compile the latitude and longitude coordinates into vectors in a larger list.
    Then, it runs through that list and does a series of actions: First, it eliminates the cardinal direction letter. Then, it splits the latitude into whole number and decimal, turns both into numerics, divides the decimal by 60 and adds it back to the whole number to find the latitude coordinate as a decimal 
    (it multiplies by -1 if the original direction was West). Then it does the same for longitude. Then it turns both coordinates back into characters and concatenates them, with the delimiter selected by the user. It returns a list of the combined latitudes and longitudes in this new format.
